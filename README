Python-packages
===============

This packages provides a convenient way (for me!) to install and update 
packages for Python. It contains a hardcoded list of python packages 
that I use; changes in that list will cause a version bump.

Installation
------------

Installation proceeds as usual with

    ./configure --prefix=<whereever>
    make
    make install

and installs a single script 

    python-packages-update
    
which - if run from the shell command line - will update the previously 
installed python packages. The script is intended to perform regular
updates of installed python packages.

A second make target,

    make install-packages
    
will install a hard-coded list of python packages; for details, see the 
list of packages to be installed in python-packages-install.sh

Caveats
-------

I currently do not install database interfaces apart from the builtin SQLite
database, although SQLAlchemy is supported.

And of course, the list of packages useful in my work might not be useful
for anyone else;-)
